# Toshokan (Biblioteca)

This project is a virtual library where you can become a member and
request to borrow physical books for associated libraries.

# The idea

You want to borrow a book, so instead of just going to a library to check
if it is avaialbe and if you can borrow it you use this website to make an
appoinment to when a book is avaialbe for borrowing.

On the homepage you will be able to see all the new added books, if you want
to search for a book you can go to `search` page where you can filter the
books based on:

- Authors
- Title
- tags (e.g. fiction, science, math, etc.)
